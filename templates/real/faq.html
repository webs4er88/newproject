Don’t be afraid to check inside cabinets, test light switches, or ask about HVAC systems and insulation. You can love a home’s look, but you want to be sure it’s structurally sound too.</p>

Selling your home "For Sale By Owner" (FSBO) might save commission fees, but you could leave money on the table without proper pricing, staging, or marketing. Buying without an agent can also be risky if you're not familiar with contracts, negotiations, and local regulations. A good agent protects your interests and helps avoid costly mistakes..</p>

After your offer is accepted, a licensed inspector will examine the property’s condition—from the roof and foundation to plumbing, electrical systems, HVAC, and more. The inspection report helps identify issues you may not see during a showing. While not legally required, skipping it can be risky. It’s your opportunity to renegotiate, request repairs, or even walk away if major problems are discovered.</p>

                                                        <p>The timeline can vary, but on average, buying a home takes 30 to 60 days once you're under contract. The search process may take longer depending on your criteria and market conditions. Selling a home also typically takes 30 to 90 days, though well-priced homes in hot markets may go under contract in a matter of days.</p>

Don’t be afraid to check inside cabinets, test light switches, or ask about HVAC systems and insulation. You can love a home’s look, but you want to be sure it’s structurally sound too.</p>

                                                    <div class="toggle-content">
                                                        <p>Yes, but it’s not always recommended. Selling your home "For Sale By Owner" (FSBO) might save commission fees, but you could leave money on the table without proper pricing, staging, or marketing. Buying without an agent can also be risky if you're not familiar with contracts, negotiations, and local regulations. A good agent protects your interests and helps avoid costly mistakes..</p>

                                                        <p>A home inspection is a crucial part of the buying process. After your offer is accepted, a licensed inspector will examine the property’s condition—from the roof and foundation to plumbing, electrical systems, HVAC, and more. The inspection report helps identify issues you may not see during a showing. While not legally required, skipping it can be risky. It’s your opportunity to renegotiate, request repairs, or even walk away if major problems are discovered.</p>
